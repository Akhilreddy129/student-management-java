Bytecode Execution Process :
Java follows a well-defined multi-stage execution process:
1.Java source code (.java) is written by the developer.
2.It is compiled by the javac compiler into platform-independent bytecode (.class files).
3.The Class Loader loads bytecode into memory.
4.The Bytecode Verifier checks for illegal/opcode violations, ensuring security.
5.The Execution Engine interprets the bytecode or uses the JIT compiler to turn it into native code.
6.The Garbage Collector manages memory during program execution.
-->This system ensures Java programs are portable, secure, and efficient.
